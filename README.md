Knock off NYT Spelling Bee game for my wife to play

This is a tkinter based application hosted on replit for my wife to play the NYT Spelling Bee game. The NYT version is essentially behind a paywall now but is a game my wife enjoys playing, so I thought I would make one for her.

The game doesn't implement the exact same rules as the NYT one, things like points, a perfect pantogram word, etc are different, but functionally the game operates the same. 

## Features
Each run of the game will select a new random word from a pre-filtered list of words.

Triple tapping the score at the top will reveal the word.
